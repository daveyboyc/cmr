    <h4>Capacity Market Search</h4>
    <p>Search for power generation components in the UK Capacity Market by location, company name, or CMU ID.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location Search:</strong> Enter city, postcode, or area (e.g., "London", "SW1A", "South Yorkshire")</li>
      <li><strong>Company Search:</strong> Enter company name (e.g., "UK Power Networks", "Drax", "EDF")</li>
      <li><strong>CMU ID Search:</strong> Enter the CMU identifier (e.g., "VIT404", "DSR0123")</li>
      <li><strong>Technology Search:</strong> Enter technology type (e.g., "Battery", "OCGT", "Coal", "DSR")</li>
      <li><strong>Combined Search:</strong> Mix terms to narrow results (e.g., "London Battery Storage")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The search is intelligent and will determine what you're looking for based on your terms. Searches are not case-sensitive, and partial matches are supported.</p>

  <div id="help-auctions" class="help-section">
    <h4>Understanding Auctions</h4>
    <p>The Capacity Market runs regular auctions where providers compete to secure agreements. There are two main types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>T-4 auctions:</strong> Held 4 years ahead of the delivery year, offering longer-term visibility</li>
      <li><strong>T-1 auctions:</strong> Held 1 year ahead to fine-tune capacity requirements and address any shortfalls</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each auction results in agreements that specify how much capacity providers must deliver and the payment they'll receive per kilowatt.</p>
    <p>Auction years are displayed as badges (e.g., <span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">2023-24</span>) that you can click to view details for that specific auction year.</p>
    <p>The Capacity Market ensures the UK has sufficient electricity supply during periods of high demand or system stress. Providers receive payments for ensuring their capacity is available when needed.</p>

  <div id="help-grouping" class="help-section">
    <h4>Component Grouping</h4>
    <p>Components at the same location with the same description are grouped together to reduce duplication.</p>
    <p>Each group shows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All CMU IDs for components at that location</li>
      <li>All auction years, sorted with newest first</li>
      <li>An Active/Inactive status based on auction years</li>
      <li>Combined total capacity for all components in the group</li>
      <li>Consistent technology type and description shared by all components</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Grouping helps identify multi-year contracts and related components at the same site. This makes it easier to understand the scale and persistence of capacity at particular locations.</p>
