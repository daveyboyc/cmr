It is located in Northwich, Cheshire and consists of three generating units: 1 gas turbine (GT) and 1 steam turbine (ST) (CHP Technology Class) and 1 gas turbine (OCGT technology class). The original configuration of the CHP is 2 x GT 39.97 MW each, both feeding into separate Heat Recovery Boilers, and 1 x ST 58.12 MW (Unit Registered Capacity). These are calculated values from the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement values given as: each GT 47.024 MVA, ST 68.38 MVA and using a power factor of 0.85 (also from Connection Agreement). Due to recent (Feb 2014) permanent operational changes resulting in a significant reduction in steam demand from the CHP Plant, the 58.12 MW steam turbine can no longer be operated. Winnington CHP Ltd is therefore applying as a refurbishing CMU as the old ST is being replaced by a new, correctly sized ST (14.63 MW) to be commissioned in September 2015. The new steam turbine has been ordered and approximately \u00a31.3m of the \u00a35.5m project cost has been incurred already. As a consequence, the refurbishment is a capacity reduction. The CHP Plant parasitic load is 3 MW and the CHP supplies on average 13.74 MW to four other users at two different locations in Northwich (Winnington and Lostock) by private wire (Tata Chemicals Europe Ltd (TCE) Winnington: 3.33 MW, TCE Lostock: 5.53 MW, Ineos Winnington: 0.47 MW, Ineos Lostock: 4.41 MW). The calculation methods used for the Available Capacity of each generating unit are based on Rule 3.5.2(c)(iii)(bb) for the new ST and Rule 3.5.2(c)(i) for both GT\u2019s. The parasitic and associated loads were prorated and assigned to each generating unit without weighting to obtain the Available Capacity of each unit. The Anticipated De-rated Capacity of the CMU is 71.25 MW. Winnington CHP exports to the Distribution system via a single MPAN, at 132KV. The connection agreement permits an export in excess of the Anticipated De-rated capacity of the refurbished CMU. ",

      "Description of CMU Components": "Winnington CHP is an unlicensed (100 MW export limit) non-CMRS Refurbishing Generating CMU which provides heat and power to various adjoining manufacturing sites via pipeline and a large private wire system (Associated Load). It is located in Northwich, Cheshire and consists of three generating units: 1 gas turbine (GT) and 1 steam turbine (ST) (CHP Technology Class) and 1 gas turbine (OCGT technology class). The original configuration of the CHP is 2 x GT 39.97 MW each, both feeding into separate Heat Recovery Boilers, and 1 x ST 58.12 MW (Unit Registered Capacity). These are calculated values from the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement values given as: each GT 47.024 MVA, ST 68.38 MVA and using a power factor of 0.85 (also from Connection Agreement). Due to recent (Feb 2014) permanent operational changes resulting in a significant reduction in steam demand from the CHP Plant, the 58.12 MW steam turbine can no longer be operated. Winnington CHP Ltd is therefore applying as a refurbishing CMU as the old ST is being replaced by a new, correctly sized ST (14.63 MW) to be commissioned in September 2015. The new steam turbine has been ordered and approximately \u00a31.3m of the \u00a35.5m project cost has been incurred already. As a consequence, the refurbishment is a capacity reduction. The CHP Plant parasitic load is 3 MW and the CHP supplies on average 13.74 MW to four other users at two different locations in Northwich (Winnington and Lostock) by private wire (Tata Chemicals Europe Ltd (TCE) Winnington: 3.33 MW, TCE Lostock: 5.53 MW, Ineos Winnington: 0.47 MW, Ineos Lostock: 4.41 MW). The calculation methods used for the Available Capacity of each generating unit are based on Rule 3.5.2(c)(iii)(bb) for the new ST and Rule 3.5.2(c)(i) for both GT\u2019s. The parasitic and associated loads were prorated and assigned to each generating unit without weighting to obtain the Available Capacity of each unit.
