It is located in Northwich, Cheshire and consists of three generating units: 1 gas turbine (GT) and 1 steam turbine (ST) (CHP Technology Class) and 1 gas turbine (OCGT technology class). The original configuration of the CHP is 2 x GT 39.97 MW each, both feeding into separate Heat Recovery Boilers, and 1 x ST 58.12 MW (Unit Registered Capacity). These are calculated values from the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement values given as: each GT 47.024 MVA, ST 68.38 MVA and using a power factor of 0.85 (also from Connection Agreement). Due to recent (Feb 2014) permanent operational changes resulting in a significant reduction in steam demand from the CHP Plant, the 58.12 MW steam turbine can no longer be operated. Winnington CHP Ltd is therefore applying as a refurbishing CMU as the old ST is being replaced by a new, correctly sized ST (14.63 MW) to be commissioned in September 2015. The new steam turbine has been ordered and approximately \u00a31.3m of the \u00a35.5m project cost has been incurred already. As a consequence, the refurbishment is a capacity reduction. The CHP Plant parasitic load is 3 MW and the CHP supplies on average 13.74 MW to four other users at two different locations in Northwich (Winnington and Lostock) by private wire (Tata Chemicals Europe Ltd (TCE) Winnington: 3.33 MW, TCE Lostock: 5.53 MW, Ineos Winnington: 0.47 MW, Ineos Lostock: 4.41 MW). The calculation methods used for the Available Capacity of each generating unit are based on Rule 3.5.2(c)(iii)(bb) for the new ST and Rule 3.5.2(c)(i) for both GT\u2019s. The parasitic and associated loads were prorated and assigned to each generating unit without weighting to obtain the Available Capacity of each unit. The Anticipated De-rated Capacity of the CMU is 71.25 MW. Winnington CHP exports to the Distribution system via a single MPAN, at 132KV. The connection agreement permits an export in excess of the Anticipated De-rated capacity of the refurbished CMU. ",

      "Description of CMU Components": "Energy from waste facility located in Chineham Hampshire - Postcode RG24 8LL. It is a municipal waste incineration plant. It is based on one boiler supplying steam to one turbine-generator. Exhaust steam is condensed in a Air cooled condenser. The site normally operates at baseload . The auxiliary load is self supplied by the generator prior to export metering.  The power factor used is 0.85 for this CMU.\n\n\nWe found out that using the rules' method to calculate the capacity some of our plants would not be able to meet their obligation. For instance:Tyseley ERF would have to register for 28.74 MW (de-rated to 25.19 MW). And in the past two years during winter period the plant generated that capacity only 45 % of the time. This is due to the plant technology: it is an Energy from waste facility. Waste is a fuel whose characteristics (moisture content-calorific value...) can change during the year and therefore the output of the plants can change a lot. We can therefore have a few high generation periods in the year in the conditions are good and a lower generation the other times.\nTherefore we decided to calculate ourselves a capacity we would be confident to register with. We would then compare it to the rules' method calculated value; If the new value is higher than the one calculated with the rules' method then we followed the rules' method. If our method would give a lower capacity; we selected the value calculated with our method.\nThe method used is: the de rated capacity we are pre-qualifying for to bid is calculated based on the two past years winter historical output (see documents).\nThe de-rated capacity is calculated as the capacity the plant was able to achieve 80% of the time in the previous two winters. Then the value was multiplied by the inverse of the de-rating factor to obtain the Connection capacity.\n\nIn the case of this site : The site would achieve more than 90% of the time the capacity calculated using on of the CM's rules so we followed the rules.",

      "Description of CMU Components": "Winnington CHP is an unlicensed (100 MW export limit) non-CMRS Refurbishing Generating CMU which provides heat and power to various adjoining manufacturing sites via pipeline and a large private wire system (Associated Load). It is located in Northwich, Cheshire and consists of three generating units: 1 gas turbine (GT) and 1 steam turbine (ST) (CHP Technology Class) and 1 gas turbine (OCGT technology class). The original configuration of the CHP is 2 x GT 39.97 MW each, both feeding into separate Heat Recovery Boilers, and 1 x ST 58.12 MW (Unit Registered Capacity). These are calculated values from the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement values given as: each GT 47.024 MVA, ST 68.38 MVA and using a power factor of 0.85 (also from Connection Agreement). Due to recent (Feb 2014) permanent operational changes resulting in a significant reduction in steam demand from the CHP Plant, the 58.12 MW steam turbine can no longer be operated. Winnington CHP Ltd is therefore applying as a refurbishing CMU as the old ST is being replaced by a new, correctly sized ST (14.63 MW) to be commissioned in September 2015. The new steam turbine has been ordered and approximately \u00a31.3m of the \u00a35.5m project cost has been incurred already. As a consequence, the refurbishment is a capacity reduction. The CHP Plant parasitic load is 3 MW and the CHP supplies on average 13.74 MW to four other users at two different locations in Northwich (Winnington and Lostock) by private wire (Tata Chemicals Europe Ltd (TCE) Winnington: 3.33 MW, TCE Lostock: 5.53 MW, Ineos Winnington: 0.47 MW, Ineos Lostock: 4.41 MW). The calculation methods used for the Available Capacity of each generating unit are based on Rule 3.5.2(c)(iii)(bb) for the new ST and Rule 3.5.2(c)(i) for both GT\u2019s. The parasitic and associated loads were prorated and assigned to each generating unit without weighting to obtain the Available Capacity of each unit. The Anticipated De-rated Capacity of the CMU is 71.25 MW. Winnington CHP exports to the Distribution system via a single MPAN, at 132KV. The connection agreement permits an export in excess of the Anticipated De-rated capacity of the refurbished CMU. ",

      "Description of CMU Components": "Winnington CHP is an unlicensed (100 MW export limit) non-CMRS Refurbishing Generating CMU which provides heat and power to various adjoining manufacturing sites via pipeline and a large private wire system (Associated Load). It is located in Northwich, Cheshire and consists of three generating units: 1 gas turbine (GT) and 1 steam turbine (ST) (CHP Technology Class) and 1 gas turbine (OCGT technology class). The original configuration of the CHP is 2 x GT 39.97 MW each, both feeding into separate Heat Recovery Boilers, and 1 x ST 58.12 MW (Unit Registered Capacity). These are calculated values from the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement values given as: each GT 47.024 MVA, ST 68.38 MVA and using a power factor of 0.85 (also from Connection Agreement). Due to recent (Feb 2014) permanent operational changes resulting in a significant reduction in steam demand from the CHP Plant, the 58.12 MW steam turbine can no longer be operated. Winnington CHP Ltd is therefore applying as a refurbishing CMU as the old ST is being replaced by a new, correctly sized ST (14.63 MW) to be commissioned in September 2015. The new steam turbine has been ordered and approximately \u00a31.3m of the \u00a35.5m project cost has been incurred already. As a consequence, the refurbishment is a capacity reduction. The CHP Plant parasitic load is 3 MW and the CHP supplies on average 13.74 MW to four other users at two different locations in Northwich (Winnington and Lostock) by private wire (Tata Chemicals Europe Ltd (TCE) Winnington: 3.33 MW, TCE Lostock: 5.53 MW, Ineos Winnington: 0.47 MW, Ineos Lostock: 4.41 MW). The calculation methods used for the Available Capacity of each generating unit are based on Rule 3.5.2(c)(iii)(bb) for the new ST and Rule 3.5.2(c)(i) for both GT\u2019s. The parasitic and associated loads were prorated and assigned to each generating unit without weighting to obtain the Available Capacity of each unit. The Anticipated De-rated Capacity of the CMU is 71.25 MW. Winnington CHP exports to the Distribution system via a single MPAN, at 132KV. The connection agreement permits an export in excess of the Anticipated De-rated capacity of the refurbished CMU. ",
