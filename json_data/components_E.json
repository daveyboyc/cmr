The auxiliary power will have half hourly meters, these will be installed in time to pass a Metering Test for this Capacity Market. For now, using the same method as for the T4 -2018 Capacity Market, we have determined this to be ~ 7.72s MW (maximum consumption over the three Highest Generation points) which represents 9.79% of the total Power Demand as measured at the metering points at MSID 7096.

BMU and is part of the larger site inclusive BM Trading Unit, ?EPCO1?. All Components of ?EMD-18? are located within the physical boundaries of the Esso Petroleum Company,Limited Oil Refinery at Esso Refinery - Fawley - Southampton - Hampshire - SO45 1TX - United Kingdom. \n\nUnit 3 is one of three power and steam generation units on site and is a Gas Turbine CHP plant. It is connected to the Local Distribution Network (LDN) at 132kV level at their Fawley North Sub-Station (part of MSID 7095). Both units share various auxiliary load equipment-  the power for which is supplied from another part of the LDN Fawley North Sub-Station. \n\nThere is a project currently in construction phase to install separate metering for the auxiliary power for both TG1B and Unit 3. This will provide half hourly meters for the auxiliary load for the two units, these will be installed in time to pass a Metering Test for the delivery of this Capacity Market (they are planned for completion on 28th September 2018). This was previously agreed with the settlements body as part of an appeal process for the T-4 2018 capacity market auction. In this appeal the capacity market settlements body accepted ExxonMobil's appeal for the auxiliary meters to be installed in time for the capacity market delivery period 2018/19 i.e. 1st October 2018. \n\nFor now, using the same method as for the T4 -2018 Capacity Market, (with the successful appeal)  we have determined the auxiliary load for Unit 3 to be 2.024 MW (maximum consumption over the three Highest Unit 3 Generation points) which represents on average 7.954% of the total Power Demand as measured at the metering points at MSID 7096. \n\nDue to the large amount of common equipment shared by the three generation units we are unable to determine exactly what part of the auxiliary load is directly attributable to Unit 3 and thus for this CMU we have attributed the auxiliary load evenly about the three units - i.e. 7.954/3 = 2.6513% of MSID 7096, thus 2.024 MW.   (NB. the rest of MSID 7095 is made up of one of our other components of our CMU i.e. TG1B).\n\nTo clarify the 3 units within the refinery boundary, they are Unit 5 (EMG-18) and TG1B and Unit 3 (which make up EMD-18).

BMU and is part of the larger site inclusive BM Trading Unit, ?EPCO1?. All Components of ?EMD-18? are located within the physical boundaries of the Esso Petroleum Company,Limited Oil Refinery at Esso Refinery - Fawley - Southampton - Hampshire - SO45 1TX - United Kingdom. \n\nUnit 3 is one of three power and steam generation units on site and is a Gas Turbine CHP plant. It is connected to the Local Distribution Network (LDN) at 132kV level at their Fawley North Sub-Station (part of MSID 7095). Both units share various auxiliary load equipment-  the power for which is supplied from another part of the LDN Fawley North Sub-Station. \n\nThere is a project currently in construction phase to install separate metering for the auxiliary power for both TG1B and Unit 3. This will provide half hourly meters for the auxiliary load for the two units, these will be installed in time to pass a Metering Test for the delivery of this Capacity Market (they are planned for completion on 28th September 2018). This was previously agreed with the settlements body as part of an appeal process for the T-4 2018 capacity market auction. In this appeal the capacity market settlements body accepted ExxonMobil's appeal for the auxiliary meters to be installed in time for the capacity market delivery period 2018/19 i.e. 1st October 2018. \n\nFor now, using the same method as for the T4 -2018 Capacity Market, (with the successful appeal)  we have determined the auxiliary load for Unit 3 to be 2.024 MW (maximum consumption over the three Highest Unit 3 Generation points) which represents on average 7.954% of the total Power Demand as measured at the metering points at MSID 7096. \n\nDue to the large amount of common equipment shared by the three generation units we are unable to determine exactly what part of the auxiliary load is directly attributable to Unit 3 and thus for this CMU we have attributed the auxiliary load evenly about the three units - i.e. 7.954/3 = 2.6513% of MSID 7096, thus 2.024 MW.   (NB. the rest of MSID 7095 is made up of one of our other components of our CMU i.e. TG1B).\n\nTo clarify the 3 units within the refinery boundary, they are Unit 5 (EMG-18) and TG1B and Unit 3 (which make up EMD-18). Unit 5 now has half hourly meters installed on the auxiliary load so the estimate on auxiliary load for now is only for Unit 3 and TG1B. This will move to half hourly metering for Unit 3 and TG1B once the auxiliary load meters are installed by 28th September 2018.\n\nGross 3 HH av. peak generation from Unit 3 on separate days = 36.368 MW\nAt these three HH times, aux load on Unit 3 = 2.024 MW\nNet generation from Unit 3 = 34.344 MW",

      "Description of CMU Components": "TG1B is part of the aggregated CMU EMD-18, which is made up of 2 Generating Units of which TG1B is the larger. \n\nThis Generating Unit is embedded in the 'E_FAWND BMU' and is part of the larger site inclusive BM Trading Unit, 'EPCO1'. All Components of 'EMD-18' are located within the physical boundaries of the Esso Petroleum Company,Limited Oil Refinery at Esso Refinery - Fawley - Southampton - Hampshire - SO45 1TX - United Kingdom. \n\nTG1B is one of three power and steam generation units on the site and is a Steam Turbine plant. It is connected to the Local Distribution Network (LDN) at 132kV level at the Fawley North Sub-Station (part of MSID 7095). Both Unit 3 and TG1B units share various auxiliary load equipment- the power for which is supplied from another part of the LDN Fawley North Sub-Station. \n\nThere is a project currently in construction phase to install separate metering for the auxiliary power for both TG1B and Unit 3. This will provide half hourly meters for the auxiliary load for the two units, these will be installed in time to pass a Metering Test for the delivery of this Capacity Market (they are planned for completion on 28th September 2018). This was previously agreed with the settlements body as part of an appeal process for the T-4 2018 capacity market auction. In this appeal the capacity market settlements body accepted ExxonMobil's appeal for the auxiliary meters to be installed in time for the capacity market delivery period 2018/19 i.e. 1st October 2018. \n\nFor now, using the same method as for the T4 -2018 Capacity Market, (with the successful appeal) we have determined the auxiliary load for TG1B to be 2.024 MW (based on the total auxiliary consumption over the three Highest TG1B+Unit 3 Generation points) which represents on average 7.954% of the total Power Demand as measured at the metering points at MSID 7096. \n\nDue to the large amount of common equipment shared by the three generation units we are unable to determine exactly what part of the auxiliary load is directly attributable to TG1B and thus for this CMU we have attributed the auxiliary load evenly about the three units - i.e. 7.954/3 = 2.6513% of MSID 7096, thus 2.024 MW.   (NB. the rest of MSID 7095 is made up of one of our other components of our CMU- i.e. Unit 3). \n\nTo clarify the 3 units within the refinery boundary, they are Unit 5 (EMG-18) and TG1B and Unit 3 (which make up EMD-18). Unit 5 now has half hourly meters installed on the auxiliary load so the estimate on auxiliary load for now is only for Unit 3 and TG1B. This will move to half hourly metering for Unit 3 and TG1B once the auxiliary load meters are installed by 28th September 2018.\n\nGross 3 HH av. peak generation from TG1B on separate days = 56.634 MW\nAt these three HH times, aux load on TG1B = 2.024 MW\nNet generation from TG1B = 54.610 MW",

      "Description of CMU Components": "Unit 3 is part of the aggregated CMU EMD-18, which is made up of 2 Generating Units of which Unit 3 is the smallest. \n\nThis Generating Unit is embedded in the ?E_FAWND? BMU and is part of the larger site inclusive BM Trading Unit, ?EPCO1?. All Components of ?EMD-18? are located within the physical boundaries of the Esso Petroleum Company,Limited Oil Refinery at Esso Refinery - Fawley - Southampton - Hampshire - SO45 1TX - United Kingdom. \n\nUnit 3 is one of three power and steam generation units on site and is a Gas Turbine CHP plant. It is connected to the Local Distribution Network (LDN) at 132kV level at their Fawley North Sub-Station (part of MSID 7095). Both units share various auxiliary load equipment-  the power for which is supplied from another part of the LDN Fawley North Sub-Station. \n\nThere is a project currently in construction phase to install separate metering for the auxiliary power for both TG1B and Unit 3. This will provide half hourly meters for the auxiliary load for the two units, these will be installed in time to pass a Metering Test for the delivery of this Capacity Market (they are planned for completion on 28th September 2018). This was previously agreed with the settlements body as part of an appeal process for the T-4 2018 capacity market auction. In this appeal the capacity market settlements body accepted ExxonMobil's appeal for the auxiliary meters to be installed in time for the capacity market delivery period 2018/19 i.e. 1st October 2018. \n\nFor now, using the same method as for the T4 -2018 Capacity Market, (with the successful appeal)  we have determined the auxiliary load for Unit 3 to be 2.024 MW (maximum consumption over the three Highest Unit 3 Generation points) which represents on average 7.954% of the total Power Demand as measured at the metering points at MSID 7096. \n\nDue to the large amount of common equipment shared by the three generation units we are unable to determine exactly what part of the auxiliary load is directly attributable to Unit 3 and thus for this CMU we have attributed the auxiliary load evenly about the three units - i.e. 7.954/3 = 2.6513% of MSID 7096, thus 2.024 MW.   (NB. the rest of MSID 7095 is made up of one of our other components of our CMU i.e. TG1B).\n\nTo clarify the 3 units within the refinery boundary, they are Unit 5 (EMG-18) and TG1B and Unit 3 (which make up EMD-18). Unit 5 now has half hourly meters installed on the auxiliary load so the estimate on auxiliary load for now is only for Unit 3 and TG1B. This will move to half hourly metering for Unit 3 and TG1B once the auxiliary load meters are installed by 28th September 2018.\n\nGross 3 HH av. peak generation from Unit 3 on separate days = 36.368 MW\nAt these three HH times, aux load on Unit 3 = 2.024 MW\nNet generation from Unit 3 = 34.344 MW",

This entire metering configuration has been successfully assessed and tested. \n\nTo clarify the 3 units within the refinery boundary, they are Unit 5 (EMG-19) and TG1B and Unit 3 (which make up EMD-19).  \n\nGross 3 HH av. peak generation from TG1B on separate days = 49.863 MW\nAt these three HH times, aux load on TG1B = -1.468 MW\nNet generation from TG1B = 48.394 MW",

      "Description of CMU Components": "Unit 5 is part of the aggregated CMU EPCMU3, which made up of 3 Generating Units of which Unit 5 is the largest. This Generating Unit forms the E_FAWN-1 BMU on its own and is part of the larger site inclusive BM Trading Unit, EPCo1. All Components of EPCMU3 are located within the physical boundaries of the Esso Petroleum Company Limited Oil Refinery at Esso Refinery - Fawley - Southampton - Hampshire - SO45 1TX - United Kingdom. Unit 5 is one of three power and steam generation units on site and is a Gas Turbine CHP plant. It is connected to the Local Distribution Network (LDN) at 132kV level at their Fawley North Sub-Station. All three units share various auxiliary load equipment -  the power for which is supplied from another part of the LDN Fawley North Sub-Station. The auxiliary power is not half hourly metered but does have meters that are manually read monthly. Using the monthly data from the qualification period of the 3 Highest Performance Periods during August 2012 to July 2014 we have determined that on average the TOTAL auxiliary load for all three of the generating units is 7.63 MW which represents 9.85% of the total Power Demand as measured at the metering point MSID 7096. Due to the large amount of common equipment shared by the three generation units we are unable to determine exactly what part of the auxiliary load is directly attributable to Unit 5 and thus for this CMU we have attributed the auxiliary load evenly about the three units - i.e. 9.855/3 = 3.28%. of MSID 7096.",

      "Description of CMU Components": "ElecLink has a transmission capacity of 1000MW corresponding to its grid connection agreements and link the 400kV AC grids of France and Great Britain. ElecLink employs voltage direct current converter stations using voltage source converter technology at each side of the Channel Tunnel. 400kV AC underground cables connect the converter stations to the TSO's high voltage substations: Sellindge (NGET, UK) and Les Mandarins (RTE, France). \n\nThe converter station on the Eurotunnel site at Folkestone is connected by one 400kV AC cable circuit to the National Grid substation at Sellindge. The route length is approximately 14km.\n\nThe converter station on the Eurotunnel site at Coquelles is connected by one 400kV AC cable circuit to the RTE substation at Les Madarins. The route length is approximately 3.5km.\n\nAn approximately 52km long HVDC cable circuit connects the two converter stations via the Channel Tunnel between Folkestone and Coquelles. This involves two single-core HVDC cables operating at +-320kV DC.\n\nPlease note that in the section below we provided an address for the CMU which relates to the UK substation site at Sellindge, given this the location of the ElecLink interconnector in our bilateral connection agreement with National Grid ESO. Of course, given the CMU is an interconnector there are a variety of sites which are owned/managed by ElecLink and relate to the CMU, as additional information we have provided details of those sites below.
