It is based on one boiler supplying steam to one turbine-generator. Exhaust steam is condensed in a Air cooled condenser. The site normally operates at baseload . The auxiliary load is self supplied by the generator prior to export metering.  The power factor used is 0.85 for this CMU.\n\n\nWe found out that using the rules' method to calculate the capacity some of our plants would not be able to meet their obligation. For instance:Tyseley ERF would have to register for 28.74 MW (de-rated to 25.19 MW). And in the past two years during winter period the plant generated that capacity only 45 % of the time. This is due to the plant technology: it is an Energy from waste facility. Waste is a fuel whose characteristics (moisture content-calorific value...) can change during the year and therefore the output of the plants can change a lot. We can therefore have a few high generation periods in the year in the conditions are good and a lower generation the other times.\nTherefore we decided to calculate ourselves a capacity we would be confident to register with. We would then compare it to the rules' method calculated value; If the new value is higher than the one calculated with the rules' method then we followed the rules' method. If our method would give a lower capacity; we selected the value calculated with our method.\nThe method used is: the de rated capacity we are pre-qualifying for to bid is calculated based on the two past years winter historical output (see documents).\nThe de-rated capacity is calculated as the capacity the plant was able to achieve 80% of the time in the previous two winters. Then the value was multiplied by the inverse of the de-rating factor to obtain the Connection capacity.\n\nIn the case of this site : The site would achieve more than 90% of the time the capacity calculated using on of the CM's rules so we followed the rules.",
