      "Description of CMU Components": "Viking Link is a HVDC interconnector between GB and Danish transmission systems. \nViking Link involved the construction of two converter stations, sited in GB and Denmark. At the converter stations, alternating current electricity from the sending end is converted to direct current electricity and transmitted through the cables. The direct current electricity is converted into alternating current at the receiving end, before it is transmitted to consumers via the onshore electricity networks in GB and Denmark.\nIn GB, the grid connection point for Viking Link is at Bicker Fen substation. The converter station at North Ing Drove is 2km from the substation which is connected via AC underground cables. From the converter station, the British onshore section covers 68km of HVDC underground cable to the landfall point of Boygrift which marks the beginning of the offshore route. The marine section of the link has a total of 621km from Boygrift to the Danish landing point of Blaabjerg through British, Dutch, German and Danish waters. From the Danish landfall point in Blaabjerg the Danish onshore section of Viking Link covers 76km of HVDC underground cable to the converter station which is adjacent to the Revsing substation.",
