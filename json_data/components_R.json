The Facility will utilise conventional mass-burn technology, which is the most well proven Energy from Waste technology currently available. The process will consist of delivery of waste to the Facility by truck, where it will be deposited in a storage bunker, from which it will be fed into one of three thermal units (or ?streams?). Each of the three streams will consist of a moving grate, boiler and air pollution control equipment. The steam generated by this process will drive a turbine generator producing electricity that will be delivered to the local electricity distribution system via a new underground connection to the Marston Primary Substation. The electricity produced will be sufficient to meet the needs of approximately 65,000 homes",
